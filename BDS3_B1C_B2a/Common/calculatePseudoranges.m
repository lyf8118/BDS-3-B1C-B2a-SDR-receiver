%       currMeasSample  - current measurement sample location(measurement time)
%       localTime       - local time(in GPST) at measurement time
%       channelList     - list of channels to be processed

%
%   Outputs:
%       pseudoranges    - relative pseudoranges to the satellites. 

%       transmitTime    - transmitting time of channels to be processed 
%                         corresponding to measurement time  
%       localTime       - local time(in GPST) at measurement time
