function [navSolutions, eph] = postNavigation(trackResults, settings)
%Function calculates navigation solutions for the receiver (pseudoranges,
%positions). At the end it converts coordinates from the WGS84 system to
%the UTM, geocentric or any additional coordinate system.
%
%[navSolutions, eph] = postNavigation(trackResults, settings)
%
%   Inputs:
%       trackResults    - results from the tracking function (structure
%                       array).
%       settings        - receiver settings.
%   Outputs:
%       navSolutions    - contains measured pseudoranges, receiver
%                       clock error, receiver coordinates in several
%                       coordinate systems (at least ECEF and UTM).
%       eph             - received ephemerides of all SV (structure array).
